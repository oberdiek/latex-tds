babel: some files are outsourced in bghyphen project

General design principles:
* Remove redundant files. A file should not be present
  in several sub trees.
  * Especially there should not be file duplicates in TDS:source.
  Remember, the purpose of TDS:source is not to mirror CTAN.
  The TDS tree is in the state *after* the installation.
* Other files that do not fit in the special purpose sub trees
  (tex, doc, makeindex, ...) go into source, example:
  latexbug.el from latex/base. Then they do not get lost at least.
* Page layout: a4paper
  * decreases the number of pages
  * it's the default where I am living.
* Documentation: PDF files, no DVI, PS files.
* ...

Special cases:
