B. PROJECT LATEX-TDS
====================

How it has started
------------------
The project started as I wanted to install the new LaTeX release 2005/12/01
that was announced at 2006/04/27. However the files aren't packed in
TDS format, ready for unpacking in the destination directory. And
the documentation files were not yes generated or the provided
PDF files misses basic features such as bookmarks or link support.
Thus this project has started, I thought I could finish it during
the afternoon at the day of the announcement ...

Goals of the project
--------------------
* From the sources a TDS compliant tree is constructed and populated.
  The zipped result is distributed.
* All the documenation is generated from the sources. The PDF files
  are user friendly and provide navigational support with bookmarks
  and links.
* The PDF files are postprocessed to reduce the file size.

Scope
-----
I don't have the time to assemble a TeX distribution with
thousands of packages. Therefore I restricted me to the
LaTeX base distribution and the required bundles.
In the following I will use the term `module' for a package bundle.

Module list
-----------
* base      CTAN:macros/latex/base.zip
* tools     CTAN:macros/latex/required/tools.zip
* cyrillic  CTAN:macros/latex/required/cyrillic.zip
* amslatex  CTAN:macros/latex/required/amslatex.zip
            ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amslatex.zip
            ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amsrefs.zip
* psnfss    CTAN:macros/latex/required/psnfss.zip
* babel     CTAN:macros/latex/required/babel.zip

C. DOWNLOAD
===========

--> At time of writing, the project is not yet available on CTAN.
--> Thus I am describing here a proposal only.

The home of the project is located at:
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/latex-tds/

From there the following files can be downloaded:
* readme.txt (this file)
* The module distribution files, see the module list above
  for the available modules, e.g:
    base-tds.zip
    tools-tds.zip
    ...
* The sources, mainly the build script, configuration and
  driver files, and patches:
    src-tds.zip
* And the universe, the contents of all the other ZIP files,
  merged together:
    latex-tds-tds.zip


C. INSTALLATION HINTS
=====================

Hopefully the result of this project helps you in the installation
process. You get a TDS compliant tree just by unpacking.

Example:
  cd /some/where/texmf
  unzip latex-tds-tds
or unzip's option `-d':
  unzip latex-tds-tds -d /some/where/texmf

Instead of the universe ZIP files single modules can be selected.

Important to remember, point your unpack process right in
the root directory of your TDS tree. The directory structure
in the ZIP files start with the top-level directories:
  doc/latex/base/...
  tex/latex/tools/...
  source/...
Rationale: The root directory of a TDS tree can have different
names, such as texmf-dist, texmf-local, ...

Hints
-----
* Refresh the file name database.
* Be aware that unpacking can insert and update files, but never
  deletes obsolete ones. Remainders of previous releases can
  cause trouble.
* Depending on the module further installation steps can be
  necessary, consult the module's own documentation.

[base]
  * Formats need rebuilding (e.g., fmtutil).
[babel]
  * Most hyphenation patterns aren't provided here. Usually you can
    find them somewhere below CTAN:language/hyphenation.
  * Language configuration (language.dat), see the documentation of
    your TeX distribution.
  * Formats need rebuilding.
[psnfss]
  * The map files need further configuring (e.g., updmap).
[graphics]
  * Module graphics doesn't provide all driver files, because some are
    developed independently (pdftex.def, ...).

F. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
====================

* Compliance with the latest TDS specification.
* No redundancy.
* User friendly PDF files with navigational support:
  * bookmarks
  * links
* Complete documentation. The documentation generation with
  enhanced PDF files is the tricky part and should be saved
  from the user.
* Output format of generated documentation is PDF, see above.
  Other formats such as DVI or PS are not generated and provided.
* Documentation bundles are preferred to many partial documentation
  files (e.g. source2e.pdf or ltnews.pdf).
* If several expansion stages of a documentation are available,
  then just the most complete expansion stage should be used.
* Files that do not fit in a program sub tree of TDS stay below
  TDS:source (e.g. latexbug.el from latex/base). Then they do not
  get lost at least.
* Page layout: a4paper with reduced vertical margins (exception: ltnews).
  (This also decreases the page number usually.)
* ...


G. REMARKS
==========

Base
----
* source2e.pdf is used instead of many single lt*.pdf files.
* ltnews.pdf is introduced to avoid cluttering the doc directory
  with many single sheet ltnews*.pdf files.
* ...

Tools
-----
* Added: tools.pdf as overview/contents/index file with links
  and short descriptions of the single packages. (It uses
  the data from manifest.txt).
* ...

AmSLaTeX
--------
* The distribution from the AMS ftp site is used, because
  the files are already sorted in TDS:
    ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amslatex.zip
    ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amsrefs.zip
* ...

Babel
-----
* TDS format: Currently I am following here some TeX distributions
  (teTeX, TeXLive, VTeX) that use `generic' as TDS format, but I don't
  understand the reason:
  * I would rather put pure LaTeX files in TDS:tex/latex/babel
    and the other files that also can be used with plain formats in
    TDS:tex/generic/babel. It is the _purpose_ of TDS's format concept
    to allow the format dependend programs an efficient lookup.
  * The documentation and source would go in TDS:doc/latex/babel and
    TDS:source/latex/babel, because babel is a project related to
    the LaTeX project, e.g. the CTAN location is even in the _require_
    part of the LaTeX subtree, CTAN:macros/latex/required/babel.
* Babel already contains babel.pdf as documentation. It is a superset
  of user.pdf. Thus I have dropped the latter one to avoid redundancy.
  Also the name `babel.pdf' is much more useful (texdoc).
* It is unclear, which hyphenation patterns are in the control of babel.
  Comparing the version of duplicate hyphenation pattern files
  in CTAN, I decided:
  * iahyphen.tex -> TDS:tex/generic/hyphen
  * icehyph.tex  -> TDS:tex/generic/hyphen
  * lahyph.tex -> TDS:source/generic/babel
  * The bulgarian patterns are removed, because they form a new CTAN
    project: CTAN:language/hyphenation/bghyphen
* It seems, nobody has generated the documentation since a long time.
  Several patches are necessary for error free compiling.
* ...


H. BUILD HINTS
==============

The most important advice I can give: `forget it'!
The purpose of the source files are rather to show, what was
done in which way.
The *-tds.zip files are the goal of the project, not the
build process. Some remarks, if someone wants to build the
modules himself:
* TeX compiler: pdfTeX 1.40, below 1.30 some of the packages
  will not work.
* Uptodate LaTeX is recommended.
* Additional packages can be necessary, e.g. I had to install
  language/armenian, fonts/tipa, fonts/wsuipa, fonts/fc,
  fonts/utopia, fonts/greek/cbfonts, ...
  Probably TeXLive would be a good idea (I haven't tested).
* Some packages of mine I haven't updated yet (hyperref, ...).
* Some new packages of mine I will put on CTAN, but at time
  of writing, they aren't available yet.
* PDF postprocessing, I have used two steps:
  1. a) I have written a tool that analyzes page stream contents and
        optimizes them (removal of unnecessary color settings, minimize
        translation operations, ...).
        --> pdfbox-rewrite.jar
     b) For reading and writing the PDF file I have used PDFBox
        --> PDFBox-0.7.2.jar (http://www.pdfbox.org/)
     c) To get better results I patched some of the classes
        of PDFBox (double instead of float for numbers, write module).
        --> pdfbox-rewrite.jar
  2. The final conversion step was done by Mulitivalent, because
     it makes a very good job in PDF compression:
     --> Multivalent20060102.jar (http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/)
  Multivalent and PDFBox are available, pdfbox-rewrite.jar, however,
  is just a first prototype, not ripe for a release.
  But you can give the build script the option --nopostprocess,
  that will skip the postprocess steps. Or you modify the
  function to use the Multivalent step only.
* Unix, Perl background is expected.
* No support or documentation.


I. HISTORY
==========

2006/04/27
  * Start of the project (without babel, amslatex, psnfss).
2006/06/01
  * Module amslatex added.
2006/06/03
  * Modules psnfss and babel added, now the all modules are covered.
2006/06/??
  * The project hits CTAN.


K. FUTURE
=========

Possible extensions
-------------------
* graphics-add
  Uptodate graphics drivers that are missing in the graphics bundle:
  - pdftex.def
  - ???
* CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
  The amount of integration work would be very small for me.
